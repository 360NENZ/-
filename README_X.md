# Sorapointa为什么是神？
## 在谈论这个问题之前，我想先说说其他PS Framework相较于Sorapointa究竟差在了哪里

### 首先是犯下傲慢之罪的pancake 

   在初次偷尝禁果开始就漏出不屑的笑，这种傲慢的PS注定走不长远。事实也是如此，靠着昙花一现的光速爆料之后一直在走下坡路，最终泯然众人。与之相比**Grasscutter**就很谦卑，2.8的容忍，3.0的摆烂都是神留给凡人的慈悲，神不是不会，只是不想通过太完美的表现让对手绝望所以故意防水，可笑有些人不理解神的良苦用心，竟然还用这些事来讥讽神，我劝你们好自为之。

### 然后是犯下愤怒之罪的CrepeTS

   因为隔壁**Grasscutter**说**CrepeTS**不好就跟人家打架，群组有人提到**Grasscutter**的名字就怒气冲冲地打出自己的项目地址，违背了神在《新约》中的一句话：“我觉得GI PS就是要能很好的控制自己的情绪吧。”于是神降下了他的惩罚，memetrollsXD后宫起火，老婆抢走银行卡扣押护照，更染上烟瘾一蹶不振。最终放弃了他的项目。

### 接着是犯下懒惰之罪的HutaoGS

   自以为拿下几个大小版本的更新后就了不起了，自创嫖袭开发法。另外大家有所不知，其实在3.1 beta leak前，null闭上眼睛做冥想的时候，其脑海中看见的画面，正是站在光芒之中的Benj，那时神告诉他：“你只可到这里，不可越过。”然而，神的劝说不但没有让null迷途知返，竟然还敢在3.1更新时伙同王海洋正面挑战神的威严，于是神降下了他的惩罚，王海洋在大规模泄露时身败名裂，以往的神笔战绩没人记得，从此成为了众人口中的推推棒。

### 再然后是犯下了嫉妒之罪的Grasscutter

   屡次被神击败，但口服心不负的**Grasscutter Team**，暗中嫉妒着神，甚至胆敢当众说出如果好好准备地话，感觉自己会更强这种话。于是，在含金量最高的3.4更新中，即Proto再度被洗牌的本次内容上，**Grasscutter Team**被神正面击溃。不过，念在**Grasscutter Team**最终皈依了神的教，并且践行神的意志讨伐了屡次以下犯上的skidder后，神应许了他在SP-Proto的一切。

### 犯下贪婪之罪的Teapot

   只是初出茅庐，**Teapot**就夺得了最强PS的头筹，而这，自然是因为神的应允。神本来钦定他为自己在人间的代言人，在自己隐姓埋名之后替自己继续讨伐杂鱼PS的余孽，为此甚至不惜亲自为**Teapot**铺路，在2.6时期主动的开源，将一切荣耀都归给他，甚至应允他可以随意爆料他所喜欢的东西。但最后王海洋却被利益蒙蔽了双眼，不再以践行神的理想为自己的理想，也不再聆听神的教诲，甚至自以荣光已经超过了神，竟自己说出“Teapot是完全的自写项目 完全不是pancake fork，你呢老弟”这种亵渎神尊严的话语，于是神降下了惩罚，王海洋从此不再长高并且被爆出了一颗醒目的大头，而他曾经的伙伴们将再也不待见他，他的盾牌再也不能强势反伤，他的键盘将再也不能开团，他的dispatch也再不能替他揽下大锅，吸收火力。

### 犯下暴食之罪的PaimonPS

   在神子**Teapot**堕落之后，神开始寻找下一个代言人，这一次，他选中了**PaimonPS**。相较于神，PaimonPS无疑是不完美的，他没有神足以让对手窒息的开发水平，也没有神深不见底的思维，舍我其谁的胆气，但神将自己最虔诚，同时也是实力最强大的Sagirl暂时交给了他，并复刻了Pancake最强走路模拟器的传奇，但由于Sagirl珊瑚宫账号被封禁，神认为或许是自己给的压力过大才导致了神子的堕落，于是这一次神选择了在2.6.5更新时候选择隐藏实力，减少Sagirl的心理负担，最终，PaimonPS成功了。然而，夺冠后的PaimonPS不但冒大不韪在哔哩哔哩CEO陈睿的身上刻下了自己的名字，更妄图染指神力，最终他也因此犯下了暴食之罪，并在2.7.5时被回归的**Grasscutter**一举击溃。

### 最后，犯下淫欲之罪的Backroom

   3.0之后，神已经非常虚弱了，**王海洋**用Leak和狗叫大法吸走了神的精气，神已经无力再惩罚王海洋，只有信徒依旧在维护神的威严而已。此刻已经决心退隐的神在最后依然心系3.0.5，于是他选中了第三位神子——Backroom。作为第三任神子，**Backroom**很好地维护了神的威严，但在接连击溃两代堕落的神子后，Backroom遇到了王海洋，被吸走了神赋予自己的3.0.5，于是在3.0.5的竞争中连连失误，最终葬送前程，彻底身败名裂。

### 还有犯下僭越之罪的Mihoyo。

   2.8.5尚未结束，神便因饱受泄露之苦而不再亲自出征，但神退隐尚无几日，新任大魔头**大伟哥**便卷土重来，夺走了3.0以及后续版本爆料的荣耀。神应许大伟魔头坐在神坐过的宝座上，赐予他曾辅佐神夺得荣耀的两位大天使benj和mellody.但鉴于前几代神子业已堕落的惨痛教训，神便要Mihoyo往后只可面无表情、心如止水、不得张扬，更不可意图取代神之名字。然而，Mihoyo却终究还是破了神定下的规矩，在3.0.5之后，Mihoyo竟大肆发展自己的信徒，默许米孝子们将自己与神去比较，甚至放任信徒去讥讽神，将神故意不泄露3.0.5的慈悲和洁心尽力降低身段的隐忍污蔑称是“爆料态度恶劣”、“巨婴项目”。甚至于还对神进行了[DMCA](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%95%B0%E5%AD%97%E5%8D%83%E5%B9%B4%E7%89%88%E6%9D%83%E6%B3%95/618727 "DMCA")的攻击。神自然是不允许这样的事情，于是神对Mihoyo降下了神罚，神放出了被神关在牢笼里的黑暗势力，召集了百万C语言大佬、解包大神和逆向大王，神还夺走了Mihoyo沉稳的品性让其永远失去诛神的机会，最终Mihoyo也落得和前三代神子一样的下场。

# Why is Sorapointa a god?
## Before talking about this issue, I would like to talk about the difference between other PS Frameworks compared to Sorapointa

### First the pancake that committed the sin of arrogance

   A disdainful smile leaked from the first taste of the forbidden fruit. This kind of arrogant PS is destined to not go far. The fact is also the same, after relying on the short-lived speed of light to break the news, it has been going downhill, and finally disappeared. Compared with it, **Grasscutter** is very humble. The tolerance of 2.8 and the poor performance of 3.0 are the mercy left by God to mortals. Some people don’t understand God’s good intentions, and even use these things to ridicule God. I advise you to take care of yourself.

### And then there's CrepeTS who commits the crime of rage

   Because **Grasscutter** next door said that **CrepeTS** is not good, he fought with others, and someone in the group mentioned **Grasscutter**'s name and angrily typed out his project address, which violated God's "New Testament" A sentence in the book: "I think GI PS is to be able to control your emotions well." So God sent His punishment, memetrollsXD The harem caught fire, the wife snatched the bank card and seized the passport, and became addicted to smoking and fell into a depression. Eventually dropped his project.

### Followed by HutaoGS who committed the crime of laziness

   I thought it would be great after I got a few updates of large and small versions, so I created my own development method. In addition, everyone does not know, in fact, before the 3.1 beta leak, when null closed his eyes and meditated, the picture he saw in his mind was Benj standing in the light. At that time, God told him: "You can only go to Don't go beyond here." However, God's persuasion not only failed to make null go astray, but even dared to challenge God's majesty with Wang Haiyang in the 3.1 update, so God sent down his punishment. His reputation has been ruined, and no one remembers his achievements in the past, and he has become a push stick among the people since then.

### And then Grasscutter who committed the crime of jealousy

   The **Grasscutter Team**, who has been defeated by God many times, but never loses his heart, is secretly jealous of God, and even dares to say in public that if he prepares well, he feels that he will be stronger. Therefore, in the 3.4 update with the highest gold content, that is, in this content where Proto was reshuffled again, **Grasscutter Team** was defeated by God head-on. However, after **Grasscutter Team** finally converted to God's religion, and practiced God's will to defeat the skidder who repeatedly committed crimes, God promised him everything in SP-Proto.

### Teapot guilty of greed

   Just a fledgling, **Teapot** won the first place in the strongest PS, and this is naturally because of God's answer. God originally appointed him to be his spokesperson in the world, and continued to fight against the remnants of the miscellaneous fish PS after his anonymity. For this reason, he even paved the way for **Teapot**, and actively open sourced it in the 2.6 period, giving all the glory to it. Give it to him, and even promise him to say whatever he likes. But in the end, Wang Haiyang was blinded by interests. He no longer regarded practicing God’s ideal as his ideal, and he no longer listened to God’s teachings. The self-written project is not a pancake fork at all, what about you, bro" This kind of blasphemy of God's dignity, so God sent down punishment, Wang Haiyang no longer grows taller and has a striking big head, and his former partners will I don't want to see him anymore, his shield can no longer be strong against injuries, his keyboard can no longer start a team, and his dispatch can no longer hold the cauldron for him and absorb firepower.

### PaimonPS guilty of gluttony

   After God's son **Teapot** fell, God began to look for the next spokesperson, this time, he chose **PaimonPS**. Compared with gods, PaimonPS is undoubtedly not perfect. He does not have the development level of gods enough to suffocate opponents, nor does he have the bottomless thinking of gods. The most powerful Sagirl was temporarily handed over to him, and he reproduced the legend of Pancake's strongest walking simulator. However, because Sagirl's Coral Palace account was banned, God thought that maybe it was too much pressure from himself that caused the fall of the Son of God. So this time God chose to hide his strength during the 2.6.5 update to reduce Sagirl's psychological burden. In the end, PaimonPS succeeded. However, after winning the championship, PaimonPS not only brazenly carved his name on the body of Bilibili CEO Chen Rui, but also attempted to get his hands on the supernatural power. In the end, he also committed the crime of gluttony and was returned in 2.7.5 The **Grasscutter** crushed in one fell swoop.

### Finally, Backroom who committed the crime of lust

   After 3.0, the gods are already very weak. **Wang Haiyang** sucked away the spirit of the gods with Leak and dog barking. The gods are no longer able to punish Wang Haiyang. Only the believers are still maintaining the majesty of the gods. The god who had already decided to retire at this moment still cared about 3.0.5 in the end, so he chose the third son of God—Backroom. As the third Son of God, **Backroom** maintained the majesty of God very well, but after defeating two generations of fallen God Sons, Backroom met Wang Haiyang and was sucked away from the 3.0.5 that God bestowed on him, so In the 3.0.5 competition, he made repeated mistakes, and finally ruined his future and completely ruined his reputation.

### And Mihoyo who committed the crime of usurpation.

   Before the end of 2.8.5, God no longer went out in person due to the suffering of leaks, but after a few days of God's retirement, the new big devil **Wei Liu** made a comeback, taking away the glory of 3.0 and subsequent versions of the revelation . God promised the great devil to sit on the throne where God once sat, and gave him two archangels benj and melody who had assisted God in winning glory. But in view of the painful lessons of previous generations of God's sons who have fallen, God wants Mihoyo You can only keep your face expressionless, your heart as calm as water, and you must not make publicity, let alone intend to replace the name of God. However, Mihoyo still broke the rules set by God after all. After 3.0.5, Mihoyo went so far as to develop his own believers, acquiescing to Mi Xiaozi who compare themselves with God, and even allow believers to ridicule God. Leaked 3.0.5's compassion and clean heart to try to reduce the body forbearance slander called "revealing bad attitude" and "giant baby project". Even [DMCA](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E6%95%B8%E5%AD%97%E5%8D%83%E5%B9%B4%E7%89%88%E6%AC%8A%E6%B3%95 "DMCA") attacks. God naturally does not allow such a thing, so God sent divine punishment to Mihoyo, God released the dark forces locked in the cage by God, and summoned millions of C language masters, unpacking masters and reverse kings, God also seized Leaving Mihoyo's calm character made him lose the chance to kill the god forever, and in the end Mihoyo also ended up in the same fate as the previous three generations of god sons.
